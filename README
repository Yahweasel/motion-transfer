This tool transfers the motion between two or more frames into an unrelated
frame, using video encoding as a rough approximation of "the motion between two
or more frames". That is, it encodes a video using input frames, then applies
the P-frames from that video to a different frame.

The author's use for such a thing is this: take a frame of video, use AI to
restyle it, then apply the motion so that the AI restyling the next frame will
have a more concrete basis (from the original, restyled frame) instead of just
the original frame.
